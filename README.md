# Task Management Service

Backend microservice built in Go with MongoDB and RabbitMQ.

## Features

- CRUD for tasks
- Pagination & filtering
- MongoDB persistence
- Clean project structure

# Problem Breakdown & Design Decisions

Users need to manage tasks with basic CRUD functionality.

MongoDB was chosen as the primary database for its flexibility and easy document-based structure.

Each layer (handler, service, repository, and db) was separated to follow the Single Responsibility Principle.

The system is built as a microservice with clean interfaces, making it easy to plug into a larger ecosystem.

Gorilla Mux is used for HTTP routing due to its popularity and ease of use.

The design allows for easy expansion into additional services (like a user service) using REST, gRPC, or messaging (RabbitMQ).

Pagination and filtering are handled via query parameters for scalability.

# How to Run the Service

- Clone the repository: git clone git@github.com:abhi00999/task-management.git
- cd task-management
- Start your local MongoDB server (e.g., mongod or MongoDB Atlas)

Install dependencies:
- go mod tidy

Run the server:
- go run ./cmd/main.go
- The service will be available at http://localhost:8080

# Microservice Concepts Demonstrated
Single Responsibility Principle:
- Handlers deal with HTTP layer.
- Services handle business logic.
- Repositories interact with the DB.
- DB setup is isolated.

Loose Coupling:
- Components are modular, making unit testing and extension easier.

Scalability:
- Stateless design allows for horizontal scaling.

Inter-Service Communication:
- REST is currently used.
- Can be extended to use gRPC or RabbitMQ for async communication.

Pagination and Filtering:
- GET /tasks supports query parameters for status, limit, and skip to support large data sets.
